        <h1>Our Focus</h1>
        <p1>We are focusing on low-income communities that have little to no access to health care and facts about pollution in their enviornment. In order to fix these problems, along with others, we decided to create an app. To learn more about the app click <a id="HERE" href="Vision.html">here</a>.

        Many times, people living in areas with poor air quality also have little to no access to proper health care. Poor air quality causes certain health risks such as asthma and heart disease.

        <p1>The data table shows different categories and reports the percentage of individuals that are uninsured in Contra Costa County as a whole as well as the City of Richmond. The percentage of Richmond residents that are uninsured are greater than the County as a whole in every single category. In the household income section, it is evident that the correlation is that as the income increases the percentage of people that are uninsured decreases (health care is expensive and many residents can’t afford it!)</p1>
        <br><br><h1><b>FACTS</b></h1>
        <p1><ul>One of Richmond’s leading cause in death is heart disease. Richmond is also a city with its own Chevron refinery.</ul>
        <li>80% of Hispanic/Latino's in Richmond, California live with pollution in the air.</li>
        <ul> In the weeks following the explosion, approximately 15,000 people in the community—which is 39.5 percent Latinx, 26.6 percent Black and 13.5 percent Asian—sought medical treatment for breathing problems, chest pains, shortness of breath, sore throats and headaches.</ul></p1>
        <br><br>
        <h2><i>Management was willing to endanger the lives of Chevron employees, contractor employees and the community at large in order to save a few dollars by not shutting down a unit so it could be properly repaired and maintained. And that’s a decision they make for pure corporate profit reasons.</i>- Garrett Brown ~ Senior Saftey Offical.</h2>
